# Desktop platform adapters

LeafOS UI is a React application. Tauri hosts its compiled HTML/CSS/JavaScript in a system webview. Rust starts the native shell and registers native plugins; React components are never translated into Rust.

This is the **platform-services contract**, not the LeafOS Protocol. The LeafOS Protocol connects the UI to Core. Core's execution adapters connect Core to harnesses. Platform adapters connect the UI to the local operating system.

## Run it

Install Node as described in the UI README, Rust stable, and your platform's [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). macOS needs Xcode command-line tools; Windows needs the documented C++ tools and WebView2; Linux needs the documented WebKitGTK/system development packages.

From `interface/leafos-ui`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run desktop:dev
```

Tauri starts a dedicated Vite server on port **1420** and opens a native LeafOS window. The ordinary browser preview stays on **5173**, so the two can coexist. Rust dependencies compile on the first run.

Open **Settings → Notifications → Enable and test notifications**. Permission is checked and, if needed, requested only after this user action. There are no startup notifications or automatic permission prompts. OS consent remains the user's choice.

```sh
npm run check           # Frontend types/lint/format/build
npm run desktop:check   # Rust compile check (Rust must be on PATH)
npm run desktop:build   # Frontend + native build and platform bundles
npm run test:e2e        # Production frontend and driver-level tests
```

Before `desktop:check` on a fresh checkout, run `npm run build` to create frontend assets. Keep `Cargo.lock` and `package-lock.json` committed. `src-tauri/target` and generated schemas are ignored.

## Calling from React

Components receive `Platform` through the application entry point. They import its types, not Tauri APIs:

```ts
const result = await platform.notifications.send({
  title: 'Hello from LeafOS',
  body: 'Your React interface is connected to native desktop notifications.',
})
```

The settings control disables repeated clicks while a request is pending. Its outcomes are explicit:

- `requested`: the JavaScript plugin accepted the call. This is **not delivery confirmation**; the plugin's `sendNotification` returns void, and asynchronous native failures or OS suppression are not necessarily observable here.
- `denied`: permission was not granted, including a dismissed/default response. Nothing was sent.
- `unavailable`: this host has no implemented notification adapter. The browser intentionally does not request Web Notification permission.
- `failed`: permission checking/requesting or synchronous dispatch threw. Do not report success.

Focus modes, OS settings and notification-center behavior can prevent a visible banner. Windows notifications must be validated from an installed application; development identity/icon behavior differs. Linux requires a working desktop notification service. Verify permission denial, granting, app restart and OS settings on every supported platform. Mock-driver tests do not prove native delivery.

## Why the Rust code is small

The official notification plugin already implements the native side. Our Rust shell only registers it; there is no need to duplicate that implementation in a custom Rust command. The JavaScript plugin calls across Tauri's IPC boundary, authorized by the window capability.

The capability enables only `is-permission-granted`, `request-permission` and `notify`. No filesystem, shell or remote-origin native privileges are granted. CSP permits Tauri IPC and HTTPS connections to `*.ts.net` for the planned private backend, plus the dedicated development server for HMR. Other backend origins need a deliberate configuration choice.

## Adding another host feature

1. Add a small, typed operation and explicit unsupported/error behavior to `Platform`.
2. Implement it in the Tauri adapter, preferring a maintained official plugin.
3. Register the native plugin in Rust and grant only the commands actually used to the intended window.
4. Implement or explicitly mark unsupported in the browser adapter. Add an Electron adapter only if we actually adopt Electron.
5. Call the contract from a React feature component. Keep platform branching out of shared components.
6. Test the service's result paths and a real packaged desktop build. Add permission prompts only to deliberate user actions.

For genuinely custom native behavior, add a typed `#[tauri::command]` and register it with `generate_handler!`, then wrap the corresponding `invoke` call inside the adapter. Define narrow permissions; do not expose a generic arbitrary-command bridge. See [calling Rust](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/calling-rust/).

## Scope

Desktop alerts operate while the app can receive updates. The shared UI renders canonical inbox/read state through an injected client; its development fixture does not establish Core durability. Background `sendExisting` only checks existing permission. Local atomic claims suppress repeat attempts per notification and destination/installation/caller within one browser profile; failed requests remain in the inbox and are not automatically retried as popups. Other devices may independently alert. Snapshot/replay history never produces a burst of old alerts. Fully closed push delivery, background agents, native notification-click routing, updates, signing and cross-platform release acceptance are not implemented. Webview visibility/focus provides the typed attention capability; browser native alerts are explicitly unavailable. The development application identifier is `dev.leafos.ui`; confirm the production identifier and signing before distribution.

The same React bundle can run in a browser. Native bindings are dynamically loaded only inside Tauri; browser-only use does not initialize them. Both hosts keep their own local theme preferences. Preferences are not shared between installations and are not appropriate for secrets.

## Voice capture

The injected `Platform.recording` service owns permission requests, MediaRecorder and media tracks. Browser and Tauri webviews use the web capability when available; unsupported hosts return an explicit error. Microphone permission is requested only after the recording action. Cancel, errors and obsolete permission results stop tracks. Stopped recordings enter the ordinary durable attachment path with explicit voice-note purpose. There is no browser transcription or live two-way voice.

Tauri permits Blob image/media rendering without enabling uploaded scripts, and macOS includes the microphone usage description. Actual packaged webview recording and OS consent remain unverified; browser synthetic-media tests do not establish desktop support.
